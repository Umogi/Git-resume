# Interactive GitHub Project Showcase

This is a personal website that displays my GitHub projects in an interactive, visually appealing way. The design revolves around a rotating circular button that, when clicked, changes the projects shown on either side of the screen. Each side displays a list of my GitHub repositories, with the content dynamically updated as you interact with the rotating button.

## Features

- **Dynamic Project Listing:** The website presents my GitHub projects in two frames. Clicking the middle button triggers a rotation that switches the displayed projects.
- **Interactive UI:** The center circle rotates, and each time itâ€™s clicked, the links to different projects are cycled in and out with smooth animations.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts automatically for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

## How It Works

- The central circle, represented by a div element with a rotating background, triggers the rotation effect when clicked.
- As the circle rotates, the projects on both sides of the page switch between active and inactive states, allowing the user to see different repositories each time.
- The CSS uses custom properties for dynamic sizing and positioning, along with background gradients for an elegant, modern look.
- The JavaScript controls the logic for switching between links and updating the animations, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the content
- **CSS** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic project switching
